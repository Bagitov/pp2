# Copilot Instructions for practice02

## Project Overview
This is a Python practice repository focused on fundamental programming concepts:
- Boolean values and operations
- Conditional statements (if/else)
- Loop structures

The project is minimal and exercise-based, containing simple scripts for learning.

## Project Structure
- **2.py** - Main practice script (currently a "Hello, World!" example)
- **README.md** - Project description and learning focus areas

## Key Development Patterns

### Python Conventions
- Simple, direct code style with minimal complexity
- Educational focus: prioritize clarity and basic best practices
- Exercises may be incomplete or intentionally simple for learning purposes

### Running Code
Execute scripts directly with Python:
```bash
python 2.py
```

## When Suggesting Changes
- Emphasize learning value: explain concepts being demonstrated
- Keep examples simple and focused on one concept
- Reference the specific practice areas: booleans, conditionals, loops
- Avoid over-engineering; this is a practice repository

## File Roles
- **2.py**: Primary exercise file for implementing or expanding practice problems
- **README.md**: Documents the learning objectives and project scope
